  "instructions": [
    "In a saucepan or microwave-safe bowl, combine cream, milk, sugar, and corn syrup. Gently warm and stir until sugar is dissolved. Do not boil.",
    "Stir in vanilla extract, salt, and optional alcohol.",
    "Cool to room temperature, then pour into Ninja Creami pint container. Freeze for at least 24 hours until solid.",
    "After freezing, remove from freezer and let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes.",
    "Spin once using the Lite Ice Cream or Gelato setting.",
    "If crumbly, add 1–2 tbsp of whole milk and re-spin.",
    "Make a well in the center of the pint and add the caramel sauce. Run the Mix-In cycle to swirl it in.",
    "If the ice cream is too soft or soupy after the Mix-In, return it to the freezer for 30–60 minutes to firm up to scoopable texture."
  ],
  "tips": [
    "Use room temperature caramel sauce to avoid melting the ice cream too much during the Mix-In.",
    "If you prefer chewy caramel chunks, refrigerate the sauce and use it cold for the Mix-In.",
    "Avoid over-spinning—repeated spins can make the ice cream too soft.",
    "A shallow container helps leftovers firm up evenly without getting rock hard."
