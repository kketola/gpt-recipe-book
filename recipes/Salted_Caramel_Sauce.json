    { "name": "White granulated sugar", "amount_g": 200 },
    { "name": "Unsalted butter (room temperature)", "amount_g": 90 },

  "rest_time": "10 minutes (cool before using)",
  "instructions": [
    "Cut butter into cubes and let sit at room temperature for 20–30 minutes.",
    "Warm heavy cream slightly in microwave or stovetop until just warm to the touch—not hot.",
    "Add sugar to a clean, dry, light-colored saucepan. Heat over medium without stirring until it begins to melt around the edges.",
    "Swirl the pan gently as more sugar melts. Do not stir with a spoon. Continue until fully melted and medium amber in color.",
    "Immediately remove from heat and add butter in batches, whisking constantly until fully incorporated.",
    "Slowly pour in warm cream while whisking. Mixture will bubble vigorously. Continue whisking until smooth.",
    "If lumps form, return to low heat and whisk gently until smooth.",
    "Stir in salt and optional vanilla extract. Let cool 10–15 minutes before transferring to a jar."
  ],
  "tips": [
    "Always prep ingredients in advance—caramel moves quickly.",
    "Avoid stirring sugar before it melts. Only swirl the pan to prevent crystallization.",
    "Make sure butter is room temperature and cream is warmed to avoid shocking the caramel.",
    "Store in a jar in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Microwave briefly before using if too thick.",
    "Use room temp for smooth ribbon swirls or chilled for chewier mix-in bites."
